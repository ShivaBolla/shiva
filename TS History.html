<h1>History of Telangana</h1>



The history of Telangana, located on the high Deccan Plateau, includes its being ruled by the Satavahana Dynasty (230 BCE to 220 CE),
 the Kakatiya Dynasty (1083–1323), the Musunuri Nayaks (1326–1356), the Delhi Sultanate, the Bahmani Sultanate (1347–1512), Golconda 
 Sultanate (1512–1687) and Asaf Jahi dynasty (1724-1950).
In 1724, Nizam-ul-Mulk defeated Mubariz Khan and conquered Hyderabad. His successors ruled the princely state of Hyderabad, as
 Nizams of Hyderabad. The Nizams established first railways, postal and telegraph networks, and the first modern universities in
  Telangana.After Indian independence, the Nizam did not sign the instrument of accession to India. The Indian army invaded and 
  annexed Hyderabad State in 1948. In 2014, Telangana became the 29th state of India, consisting of the thirty-three (33) districts,
   with Hyderabad as its capital.[2] The city of Hyderabad will continue to serve as the joint capital for Andhra Pradesh and the
    successor state of Telangana for a period of ten years up to 2024.



<h1>Early history</h1>

<h3>Satavahana Dynasty</h3>
                   The Satavahanas rose to a political power, after the fall of the Mauryan Empire. Koti Lingala seems to be one of the 30 cities of
 Satavahana dynasty.[4] Excavations revealed brick wells, coins belonging to a pre-Satavahana period, namely, Gobhada and Samagopa.
  It is believed that the place is the site of the hermitage of sage Bhavari.[5] Several coins of Simukha, the founder of the 
  Satavahana dynasty, and those of other early rulers like Kanha and Satakarni I were found.
The Deccan, during this period, was an emporium of inland and maritime trade. The region between the rivers of Godavari and Krishna
 was full of ports and throbbing with activity[citation needed]. There was plentiful of currency to facilitate trade and the people
  entered upon a period of great industrial, commercial and maritime activity. Buddhism flourished throughout the period and the 
  rulers were also devoted to Vedic ritualism. They constructed several Buddhist Stupas, Viharas and Chaityas. Satavahanas were
   able rulers and loved literacy and architecture. The 17th ruler of this dynasty, Hāla was a great poet and his "Gathasaptasati"
    in Prakrit was well received by all. Gunadhnya, the minister of Hala was the author of "Brihatkadha". According to Matsya Purana,
     there were 29 rulers of this dynasty. They ruled over for about 456 years, from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD.
      The empire included most of the southern peninsula and some southern parts of the present Indian states of Maharashtra,
       Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. The court language used by the Satavahanas was Prakrit.The decline and fall of the Satavahan
        Empire left the state in a political chaos. Local rulers, as well as invaders, tried to carve out small kingdoms for 
        themselves and to establish many dynasties. Such instability continued to prevail until the rise of the Western Chalukyas.

 <h3>Kakatiya dynasty</h3> 
       The 12th and 13th centuries saw the emergence of the Kakatiya dynasty.[8] The Kakatiyas are known for their famous architecture
        such as Warangal Fort, Ramappa Temple, Thousand Pillar Temple and Kota Gullu.At first they were feudatories of the Western
         Chalukyas of Kalyani, ruling over a small territory near Warangal. A ruler of this dynasty, Prola II (1110–1158),
          extended his sway to the south and declared his independence. His successor Rudra (1158–1195) pushed the kingdom to 
          the east up to the Godavari delta. He built Warangal Fort to serve as a second capital and faced the invasions of the 
          Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri. The next ruler, Mahadeva, extended the kingdom to the coastal area. Ganapati Deva succeeded
          him in 1199. He was the greatest of the Kakatiyas and the first after the Satavahanas to bring almost the entire Telugu
           area under one unified empire. Ganapati put an end to the rule of the Velanati Cholas in 1210 and extended his empire
            to Anakapalle in the north.The most prominent ruler in this dynasty was Rani Rudrama Devi (1262–1289), one of the few
             queens in Indian history. An able fighter and ruler, Rudrama defended the kingdom against the Cholas and the Seuna Yadavas,
              earning their respect. Marco Polo visited India during her reign and made note of her rule.On the death of Rudrama 
              at the beginning of 1290, her grandson Prataparudra II ascended the throne. Prataparudra had to fight battles 
              throughout his reign against either internal rebels or external foes. Prataparudra expanded his borders to the
               west to Raichur and in the south to Ongole and the Nallamala Hills, whilst introducing many administrative reforms,
                some of which were also later adopted in the Vijayanagara empire. In 1309, the Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji 
                sent his general Malik Kafur on an expedition to the Kakatiya kingdom.[12] Kafur's army reached the Kakatiya 
                capital Warangal in January 1310, and breached its outer fort after a month-long siege.[13] The Kakatiya ruler 
                Prataparudra decided to surrender and agreed to pay tribute. Kafur returned to Delhi in June 1310 with a huge 
                amount of wealth obtained from the defeated king.

 <h3 Bahmani and Deccan Sultanates></h3>
                The Bahmani Sultanate ruled the region in the 15th century. In 1463, Sultan Muhammad Shah Bahmani II dispatched
                 Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk to the Telangana region to quell disturbances. Sultan Quli quelled the disturbance and 
                 was rewarded as the administrator of the region. He established a base at Kakatiya hill fortress of Golconda
                  which he strengthened and expanded considerably. By the end of the century, Quli ruled from Golconda as the 
                  subedar (governor) of the Telangana region. Quli enjoyed virtual independence from Bidar, where the Bahmani
                   Sultanate was then based. In 1518, the Bahmani Sultanate disintegrated into five different kingdoms, with 
                   the others based in Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar and Bijapur. Sultan Quli declared independence from the Bahmani 
                   rule and established the Golconda Sultanate under the title "Sultan Quli Qutub Shah",[17][18] he rebuilt the
                   mud-fort of Golconda and named the city Muhammad Nagar.[19][20uring this period, the city of Hyderabad was
                    established by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah in 1591, on the banks of the Musi River.[21] The Charminar and Mecca 
                    Masjid were constructed to form a centerpiece of the city. Over the years, Hyderabad would grow as an important
                     trading center for diamonds, pearls, arms and steel.The Qutb Shahi rulers were patrons of both Indo-Persian 
                     and the local Telugu art and culture.[22] Early Indo-Islamic type of architecture is reflected in the Qutb 
                     Shahi buildings. Some examples of it include the Golconda Fort, Qutb Shahi tombs, Charminar, Mecca Masjid,
                      Khairtabad Mosque, Taramati Baradari and Toli Mosque.

<h3>Mughal conquest and rule</h3>
Mughal prince Aurangzeb spent most of his time in the Deccan, fighting local Hindu and Muslim kingdoms alike to establish Mughal
 sovereignty. The Golconda Sultanate faced various attacks by the Mughal prince Aurangzeb, who was appointed Viceroy of the Deccan
  by his father and Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. It was forced to pay an annual tribute to the Mughal Empire.In 1656, Aurangzeb 
  attacked Golconda Fort by surprise but was forced to call off the siege on orders of Shah Jahan. Therefore, a treaty was signed
   between Abdullah Qutb Shah and Aurangzeb, when the former accepted Mughal sovereignty, paid an annual tribute and married his
    daughter to Aurangzeb's eldest son.[23][24]After becoming Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb returned to the Deccan. He captured
     Hyderabad and besieged Golconda in 1687, and the refused any negotiations.[25] On 22 September 1687, after a nine month
      long siege, Golconda was captured. Abul Hasan Qutb Shah was taken prisoner, and Hyderabad's diamond trade was all but
       destroyed.

<h3>Nizams of Hyderabad</h3>
                       The Nizams of Hyderabad, also known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty, ruled Hyderabad State,[note 1]
                        which comprised Telangana, Marathwada and Kalyana-Karnataka from 1724 to 1948. Under this period
                         Hyderabad State was the largest princely state in British India, and had its own mint, currency,
                         railway and postal system. The Nizam acquired massive amounts of wealthdue to the diamond trade.

<h3 Hyderabad State (1948–1956></h3>
                      After Operation Polo, the Hyderabad State was formed and Mir Osman Ali Khan served as Rajapramukh and
                       M. K. Vellodi was elected Chief Minister of Hyderabad State.

<h3>Andhra Pradesh (1956–2014)</h3>
                      In December 1953, the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC) was appointed to form states on a linguistic 
                      basis.[41] An agreement was reached between Telangana leaders and Andhra leaders on 20 February 1956 to 
                      merge Telangana and Andhra with promises to safeguard Telangana's interests. After reorganization in 1956,
                       the region of Telangana was merged with Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh.

 <h3>Telangana State (2014–present)</h3>
                     On 30 July 2013, the Congress Working Committee unanimously passed a resolution to recommend the formation
                      of a separate Telangana state. After various stages the bill was placed in the Parliament of India in 
                      February 2014.[42] In February 2014, Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 bill was passed by the 
                      Parliament of India for the formation of Telangana state comprising ten districts from north-western
                       Andhra Pradesh.[43] The bill received the assent of the President on 1 March 2014.[44]The state of
                        Telangana was officially formed on 2 June 2014. Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao was elected as the
                        first chief minister of Telangana, following elections in which the Bharat Rashtra Samithi party
                         secured majority.[45] Hyderabad will remain as the joint capital of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh 
                         for a period, not more than 10 years.
